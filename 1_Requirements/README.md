# Automatic Traffic Signal Control For Ambulance 




## Introduction 
-These days the use of ambulance in the city has been increased due to covid.
 -Due to traffic and signals, there will be problem for the ambulance to reach itâ€™s destination. To avoid it, this project can be implemented. 

##Features
-The feature of the project is to avoid the waiting time of the ambulance in signals and traffic.
-This helps in saving time and also in saving lives. 

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats

### Strengths
- Easy to use
- Low cost
- Efficient

### Weakness
- Time Consuming 
### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by Using basic development boards.
- It can be developed easily with low cost.

### Threats 
- Time taken to implement this project will be high 
- Requires Man power.\

## components

  #### Sensors 
  * Sensor detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
  * The input can be light, signal, sound, pressure, or any other environmental phenomena.
  * The output is generally an encrypted value that is converted in readable format. 

  #### Actuators
  * An actuator is responsible for movement and control of a mechanism or device
  * An actuator requires a signal and energy source.
